# Shvasa (श्वास) — The Prana Path

**"Ancient Wisdom, Modern Science."**

Shvasa is a premium, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to guide users through a scientifically structured breathing protocol deeply rooted in Indian Vedic traditions (Pranayama). 

Unlike generic meditation apps, Shvasa focuses on **physiological state-shifting**. It utilizes controlled breath retention (Kumbhaka) and rhythmic breathing to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, lower resting heart rate, and unlock states of deep focus (Dharana).

## 🧘‍♂️ The Core User Journey: "The Prana Path"

Shvasa follows a linear, disciplined journey (Tapas) consisting of several key phases:

### 1. Tuning In
*   **Sankalpa**: Set your intention with a minimalist, meditative interface.
*   **Udgeeth (Om Chanting)**: Vagus nerve stimulation through 5 rhythmic repetitions of the sacred "Om".

### 2. Balancing
*   **Sama Vritti Warm-up**: Equal breathing to stabilize the autonomic nervous system.
*   **Chandra/Surya Bhedana**: Single-nostril breathing (Left for cooling/calm, Right for heating/energy).
*   **Anulom Vilom**: Alternate nostril breathing to purify the Nadis and balance cognitive flow.

### 3. Vitality
*   **The Test Hold**: A guided check to prepare the lungs for deep retention.
*   **Box Breathing**: Rhythmic stabilization with selectable difficulty (Apprentice vs. Yogi).

### 4. The Peak
*   **Tapas (High Intensity)**: Controlled hypoxia cycles (Hyperventilation + Retention + Recovery). 
    *   *Features automatic background darkening to minimize distraction during deep holds.*

### 5. Integration
*   **Sakshi Bhav (Witnessing)**: Meditation on the environment without reaction.
*   **Hridaya (Heart Focus)**: Final focus on the heartbeat to integrate the session's energy.
*   **The Mirror**: A detailed session dashboard showing your breath-hold capacities.

*   **Start Countdowns**: 3-2-1-GO counters ensure you are physically prepared for every transition.
*   **Haptic UI**: Silent vibration cues guide you through inhale/exhale cycles even when your eyes are closed.
*   **Adaptive Environment**: The background colors (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) shift dynamically to match the physiological state of each step.

## 📜 Philosophy
Shvasa is built on the belief that the breath is the bridge between the body and the mind. By mastering the breath, we master our capacity for life.

*"When the breath wanders the mind also is unsteady. But when the breath is calmed the mind too will be still."* — **Hatha Yoga Pradipika**
